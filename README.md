# Face-Mask-Detection

This CNN Model is built using the TensorFlow framework and the OpenCV library to detect face-mask in real-time.
This model can also be used to develop a full-fledged software to scan every person before they can enter the public gathering.
Using this model, an accuracy of over 96% is obtained. This can also be used further to achieve even higher levels of accuracy.
